# Stack-Exercise

Dear Dr Asani Emmanuel,

I sincerely apologize for the late submission of my CSC 312 classwork. I understand that the deadline was Monday, the 4th of December, and I am deeply sorry for submitting it very late.

I know late submissions are disruptive and inconvenient, and I take full responsibility for my actions. I understand that this delay may affect my grade, and I am willing to accept any consequences that come with it.

I have completed the assignment to the best of my ability and attached it to this email. I would be grateful if you could accept my late submission.

I am committed to managing my time more effectively in the future and ensuring that all future assignments are submitted on time. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

Damilola Oni
